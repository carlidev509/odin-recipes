            <li>Place the seasoned meat in a stockpot and cover with water</li>
            <li>Add oil and let boil over high heat. Keep covered until the water has evaporated.
</li>
<li>Uncover, stir and simmer a few drips of water occasionally to brown the meat.</li>
<li>Keep stirring and simmer water occasionally until you have a nice browning color to the meat.
